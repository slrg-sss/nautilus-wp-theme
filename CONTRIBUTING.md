# Contributing to the SLRG/SSS Nautilus WordPress Theme

*Thank you for taking time to contribute!
We need volunteer developers to help maintain and improve this WordPress theme.*

## How can I contribute?

* Reporting bugs and layout defects via [issues](https://github.com/slrg-sss/nautilus-wp-theme/issues)
* Suggesting enhancements and improvements via [issues](https://github.com/slrg-sss/nautilus-wp-theme/issues)
* Proposing changes via pull requests *(see below)*

## Pull Requests

When contributing to this repository, it is best to first discuss non-trivial changes you wish to make via an [issue](https://github.com/slrg-sss/nautilus-wp-theme/issues), or any other method with
the maintainers of this repository before proposing a change. This ensures that your changes have the best chance to be accepted. We are happy to provide guidance.

### Review process and stability

After you have thoroughly tested your changes, please open a new
[Pull Request on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
with a clear list of what you have done and what it adds to the project. We strive to ensure stability for the users of the theme and therefore review your contribution carefully before accepting any
changes. In this process the maintainers may request modifications for style or substance prior to merging.

### Guidelines

#### Testing

* Please test your submissions before opening a pull request.

#### Branches

* Create your branch from `main`.
* Use short branch names and use lower-case and dash (`-`) delimited names (e.g. `gh-1234` or `fix-xyz`).

#### Commits

* Keep commits focused on a single item of interest.
* Squash multiple commits into atomic changes (e.g. use `git rebase --interactive`).
* Commit messages should use the present tense (*"Add feature"* not *"Added feature"*) and imperative mood (*"Move cursor"* not *"Moves cursor"*).
* Limit the subject line of the commit message to 70 characters.
* Make sure to have configured the correct
  [`user.name`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git)
  and [`user.email`](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address).
